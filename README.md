# Articale_Classifier <hr>
**This article classification project** focused on categorizing articles into either sports or business topics using machine learning techniques. The Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB) algorithm was selected as the primary model for this task. The project encompassed preprocessing textual data, feature extraction, and training the MultinomialNB classifier. By analyzing word frequencies and patterns in the articles, MultinomialNB effectively distinguished between sports and business-related content. This project demonstrates the utility of MultinomialNB in text classification, highlighting its capacity to automate the classification of articles, thus aiding in content organization and topic-based sorting.
